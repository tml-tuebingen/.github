👋 Welcome to the GitHub Page of the [Theory of Machine Learning Group](https://www.tml.cs.uni-tuebingen.de) at the University of Tübigen.

Our focus is on the theoretical foundations of machine learning 🤖. We aim to understand algorithms from a formal perspective and provide guarantees for their performance.
👨‍🔬 

Our Research spans:

    🌈 Explainable Machine Learning
    🔎 When Machine Learning Algorithms Provably Fail
    ⚖️ Understanding Implicit Assumptions and Hidden Biases
    📐 Formal Mathematical Guarantees

Here, you will find the code and datasets that accompany our publications.
