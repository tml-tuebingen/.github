👋 Welcome to the GitHub Page of the [Theory of Machine Learning Group](https://www.tml.cs.uni-tuebingen.de) at the University of Tübigen.

Our focus is on the theoretical foundations of machine learning 📚. We aim to understand algorithms from a formal perspective and provide guarantees for their performance.
👨‍🔬 

Our Research spans:

    🌈 Explainable Machine Learning
    🔎 When Machine Learning Algorithms Provably Fail
    ⚖️ Understanding Implicit Assumptions and Hidden Biases
    📐 Formal Mathematical Guarantees

You’ll find code and datasets here that accompany our publications, making it easy to reproduce experiments and explore further. Each project comes with documentation and setup instructions to get you started!
